# MindMend - A Mental Health Support Platform

## Project Overview
MindMend is designed to address the negative effects of social media on mental health, particularly focusing on cyberbullying, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The platform is primarily aimed at teens and young adults who are disproportionately impacted by the harmful aspects of social media. By offering a safe space with supportive features, the project aims to promote mental well-being and reduce the stigma around mental health issues.

### Key Features:
- **Emotion Tracking**: Log daily moods and stress levels, helping users identify patterns over time.
- **Support Communities**: Join specialized groups for sharing experiences, offering advice, and providing emotional support.
- **Professional Access**: Connect with licensed therapists or counselors for virtual sessions or advice.
- **Self-Care Tools**: Access a library of resources such as relaxation exercises, coping strategies, and mental health tools.
- **Anonymous Sharing**: Safely post anonymously about sensitive topics without the fear of judgment.
